## A simple flashcard app

While other solutions might exist to review flashcards on the go, I decided to create this app to avoid paying subscription fees to access my flashcard decks offline, which proves quite useful when travelling in a train under water.

## Adding new cards

As it currently stands, cards are loaded in from a JSON file containing an array of cards (see "InitialSet.json" for more info on this).
